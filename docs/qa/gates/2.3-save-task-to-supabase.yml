status_reason: "All acceptance criteria implemented correctly. Code quality is good with proper error handling, security, and patterns. Minor recommendations are non-blocking enhancements. Manual testing pending but code implementation is complete."

top_issues:
  - severity: medium
    finding: "Input length validation missing - database has VARCHAR(500) limit but no client-side validation"
    suggested_owner: dev
    suggested_action: "Add length validation before insert to provide user-friendly error instead of database error"
    notes: "Non-blocking for MVP. Database will reject > 500 chars, but error handling gracefully covers this. Recommendation for future story."

      - ac_2: "VERIFIED - All fields saved: user_id (resolved from users table), text, status: 'open', created_at"
      - ac_3: "VERIFIED - Optimistic update keeps task in list (taskStore.ts:51-53), updated with server ID on success"

      - ac_5: "PENDING - Manual verification in Supabase dashboard required"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Authentication validated, RLS policies enforced, user_id correctly resolved from session, no sensitive data leakage in errors"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimistic updates provide immediate UI feedback, efficient single-query user_id resolution, proper async/await usage"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling covers network, auth, and validation failures. Rollback on failure prevents inconsistent state."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code follows established Zustand patterns, comments explain complex logic (user_id resolution, optimistic updates), type safety maintained"

recommendations:
  future:
    - action: "Add input length validation (500 char limit) before Supabase insert"
      refs: ["src/stores/taskStore.ts:20"]
      rationale: "Prevent database errors and provide user-friendly validation messages"
    - action: "Consider more specific error messages (network vs validation vs auth errors)"
      refs: ["src/screens/MainScreen.tsx:84-88"]
      rationale: "Better UX when errors occur - helps users understand what went wrong"
