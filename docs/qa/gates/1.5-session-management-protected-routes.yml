  notes: "All acceptance criteria verified via code inspection. Manual testing of session persistence required on device/simulator (expected limitation)."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Security best practices followed: AsyncStorage handled by Supabase (encryption), listener cleanup prevents memory leaks, debug logs gated behind __DEV__, protected routes pattern correct, sign out properly clears all session data. No sensitive data exposed."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lightweight session check (single getSession call), efficient Zustand store usage, loading state prevents unnecessary renders, no performance bottlenecks. AsyncStorage access optimized by Supabase."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling in auth store, network errors handled gracefully, corrupted session data handled, listener cleanup prevents leaks, state synchronization maintained via onAuthStateChange. Session persistence verified via Supabase AsyncStorage integration."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, proper TypeScript typing, clear separation of concerns (store vs component vs Supabase client), well-commented complex logic, extensible design. Zustand store pattern follows architecture guidelines."

  ac_1_zustand_store:
    status: PASS
    verified: true
    evidence:
      - "File exists: src/stores/authStore.ts"

      - "Actions implemented: setSession (line 16), clearSession (line 17), initializeSession (lines 18-50)"
      - "Hook exported: useAuthStore (line 13)"
      - "TypeScript types correct: Session from @supabase/supabase-js"
    notes: "Store implementation matches architecture patterns and story requirements perfectly."

  ac_2_session_check:
    status: PASS
    verified: true
    evidence:
      - "useEffect in App.tsx runs on mount (lines 15-47)"

      - "Loading state implemented (isLoading check, lines 50-59)"
      - "Error handling in auth store (try-catch, lines 19-50)"
    notes: "Session check properly implemented with loading state and error handling."

    verified: true
    evidence:
      - "Conditional rendering: session ? <MainScreen /> : <AuthScreen /> (line 64)"

      - "Navigation automatic via state update"
    notes: "Navigation logic correctly implemented using conditional rendering."

  ac_4_navigate_auth_screen:
    status: PASS
    verified: true
    evidence:
      - "Same conditional rendering handles no-session case (line 64)"
      - "AuthScreen displays when session is null"
      - "Initial state shows AuthScreen (session starts as null)"
    notes: "AuthScreen navigation correctly implemented."

    status: PASS
    verified: true
    evidence:
      - "initializeSession() calls supabase.auth.getSession() (line 23)"

      - "persistSession: true in Supabase config (src/lib/supabase.ts:18)"
      - "onAuthStateChange listener keeps store synchronized (App.tsx:22-41)"
    notes: "Session persistence correctly implemented. Manual testing required on device/simulator to verify app restart behavior (expected limitation for MVP)."

  ac_6_sign_out_button:
    status: PASS
    verified: true
    evidence:
      - "Sign Out button exists in MainScreen (lines 68-78)"
      - "Calls supabase.auth.signOut() (line 23)"
      - "Calls clearSession() from store (line 35)"
      - "Error handling with Alert (lines 25-31, 42-47)"
      - "Loading state during sign out (isSigningOut, lines 14, 20, 30, 47, 73-74)"
    notes: "Sign out functionality correctly implemented with proper error handling."

code_quality_findings:
  strengths:
    - "Proper listener cleanup: subscription.unsubscribe() in useEffect cleanup (App.tsx:44-46)"
    - "Debug logs gated behind __DEV__ flag throughout (authStore.ts:26,35,40,45; MainScreen.tsx:26,37,43; App.tsx:23)"
    - "Comprehensive error handling in async operations (authStore.ts:19-50, MainScreen.tsx:18-49)"
    - "TypeScript type safety: proper Session type usage, no any types (except catch blocks)"
    - "Loading states implemented to prevent UI flashing (authStore isLoading, MainScreen isSigningOut)"
    - "Clean separation of concerns: store, component, and Supabase client properly separated"
    - "State synchronization: onAuthStateChange listener properly handles all auth events (SIGNED_IN, SIGNED_OUT, TOKEN_REFRESHED, USER_UPDATED)"
