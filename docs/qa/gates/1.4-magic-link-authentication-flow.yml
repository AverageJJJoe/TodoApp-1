status_reason: "Excellent implementation quality with production-ready code. All core acceptance criteria implemented correctly. CONCERNS gate reflects documented limitations (Expo Go testing, Supabase redirect) with mitigation plans. Pre-production cleanup required (test button removal)."

    finding: "Test button present in AuthScreen (lines 244-262) - should be removed before production"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Full end-to-end deep link testing blocked by Expo Go limitation (documented and expected)"

  notes: "AC 6 code is complete and verified via test button, but full E2E testing limited by Expo Go environment"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Security best practices followed: generic error messages, input validation, secure token handling, no information disclosure. Rate limiting should be verified in Supabase Dashboard."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Lightweight API calls, efficient state management, no performance bottlenecks identified. Code structure supports scalability."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling implemented. Known limitations: Expo Go custom scheme support (expected), Supabase redirect white screen (addressed by Story 1.5). Code will work correctly in production builds."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean, readable code structure. Well-commented complex logic. Debug logging supports troubleshooting. Extensible design ready for Universal Links enhancement."
