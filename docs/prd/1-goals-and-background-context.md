# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

1. **Launch MVP in 4 weeks** - Ship functional PWA + native apps (if approved) by Week 4
2. **Validate product-market fit** - Achieve 300-500 downloads in Month 1 with 20% Day-30 retention
3. **Generate early revenue** - Reach $500 cumulative net revenue by Month 3 via tiered freemium strategy
4. **Build organic audience** - Grow X (Twitter) following through build-in-public strategy (50-100 engaged followers)
5. **Establish competitive positioning** - Position as "the anti-Todoist" for simplicity-seeking email users
6. **Prove monetization model** - Validate tiered pricing ($2.99 vs $4.99) converts at 10-12%+ rate
7. **Maximize adoption through free launch** - Remove price friction at launch, then introduce freemium in Phase 2

## 1.2 Background Context

TodoTomorrow solves a problem experienced by email-native knowledge workers: capturing sporadic evening brain dumps without cluttering their inbox or requiring manual intervention.

**The Problem:** During busy reactive daytimes, there's no time for planning. But during evenings (bed, car, waiting for kids), strategic ideas for tomorrow surface sporadically. Existing solutions fail:
- **Email drafts** - Users forget to send them, tasks never arrive in morning inbox
- **Todoist** - Too complex with overwhelming features, clutters inbox with individual reminder emails
- **TodoMailer** - Sends one email per task immediately, creating inbox spam

**The Solution:** TodoTomorrow is a mobile-first capture tool that automatically batches evening brain dumps into one clean morning email at the user's chosen time (default 6:00 AM), delivering a consolidated daily action plan directly to their inbox.

**Why This Matters:** Email remains the universal productivity hub for knowledge workers. The app doesn't try to replace emailâ€”it bridges mobile capture to email delivery. Competitive analysis reveals no existing solution offers automatic batched email delivery, creating a genuine blue ocean opportunity.

**Strategic Context:** This indie maker project targets a niche within the $50B+ productivity software market. Success is defined as sustainable solo-dev income ($500-2000/month), validated through X build-in-public strategy and Product Hunt launch.

## 1.3 Monetization Strategy Overview

TodoTomorrow uses a **tiered freemium launch strategy** to maximize adoption first, then capture revenue through data-driven pricing:

**Phase 1 (Weeks 4-6):** Launch completely FREE
- Remove all payment friction
- Build habit formation in first users
- Create testimonial cohort (grandfather'd forever)
- Target: 200-300 downloads

**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-8, Month 2):** Introduce freemium with A/B pricing test
- New users: 30-day trial, then $2.99 OR $4.99 (50/50 split)
- Early adopters: Stay free forever (grandfather status)
- Test which price point drives higher conversion
- Target: 10-12% conversion rate

**Phase 3 (Month 3+):** Scale with winning price
- Implement winner from Phase 2 test
- Sustain 12%+ conversion rate
- Optional: Test $5.99 if conversion stays strong
- Target: $500+ net revenue by Month 3

**Cohort Strategy:**
- `free_launch`: Early adopters, never charged (Weeks 4-6)
- `early_freemium_2.99`: Phase 2 test group at $2.99
- `early_freemium_4.99`: Phase 2 test group at $4.99
- `paid_cohort_v1`: Phase 3+ users at winning price
