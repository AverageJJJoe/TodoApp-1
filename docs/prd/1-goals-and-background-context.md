# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1 Goals

1. **Launch MVP in 4 weeks** - Ship functional PWA + native apps (if approved) by Week 4
2. **Validate product-market fit** - Achieve 300-500 downloads in Month 1 with 20% Day-30 retention
3. **Generate early revenue** - Reach $500 cumulative net revenue by Month 3 via tiered freemium strategy
4. **Build organic audience** - Grow X (Twitter) following through build-in-public strategy (50-100 engaged followers)
5. **Establish competitive positioning** - Position as "the anti-Todoist" for simplicity-seeking email users
6. **Prove monetization model** - Validate tiered pricing ($2.99 vs $4.99) converts at 10-12%+ rate
7. **Maximize adoption through free launch** - Remove price friction at launch, then introduce freemium in Phase 2

## 1.2 Background Context

TodoMorning solves a problem experienced by email-native knowledge workers: capturing sporadic evening brain dumps without cluttering their inbox or requiring manual intervention.

**The Problem:** During busy reactive daytimes, there's no time for planning. But during evenings (bed, car, waiting for kids), strategic ideas for tomorrow surface sporadically. Existing solutions fail:
- **Email drafts** - Users forget to send them, tasks never arrive in morning inbox
- **Todoist** - Too complex with overwhelming features, clutters inbox with individual reminder emails
- **TodoMailer** - Sends one email per task immediately, creating inbox spam

**The Solution:** TodoMorning is a mobile-first capture tool that automatically batches evening brain dumps into one clean morning email at the user's chosen time (default 6:00 AM), delivering a consolidated daily action plan directly to their inbox.

**Why This Matters:** Email remains the universal productivity hub for knowledge workers. The app doesn't try to replace email—it bridges mobile capture to email delivery. Competitive analysis reveals no existing solution offers automatic batched email delivery, creating a genuine blue ocean opportunity.

**Strategic Context:** This indie maker project targets a niche within the $50B+ productivity software market. Success is defined as sustainable solo-dev income ($500-2000/month), validated through X build-in-public strategy and Product Hunt launch.

## 1.3 Monetization Strategy Overview

TodoMorning uses a **tiered freemium launch strategy** to maximize adoption first, then capture revenue through data-driven pricing:

**Phase 1 (Weeks 4-6):** Launch completely FREE
- Remove all payment friction
- Build habit formation in first users
- Create testimonial cohort (grandfather'd forever)
- Target: 200-300 downloads

**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-8, Month 2):** Introduce freemium with A/B pricing test
- New users: 30-day trial, then $2.99 OR $4.99 (50/50 split)
- Early adopters: Stay free forever (grandfather status)
- Test which price point drives higher conversion
- Target: 10-12% conversion rate

**Phase 3 (Month 3+):** Scale with winning price
- Implement winner from Phase 2 test
- Sustain 12%+ conversion rate
- Optional: Test $5.99 if conversion stays strong
- Target: $500+ net revenue by Month 3

**Cohort Strategy:**
- `free_launch`: Early adopters, never charged (Weeks 4-6)
- `early_freemium_2.99`: Phase 2 test group at $2.99
- `early_freemium_4.99`: Phase 2 test group at $4.99
- `paid_cohort_v1`: Phase 3+ users at winning price
