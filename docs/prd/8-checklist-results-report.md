**Checklist Categories:**

1. **Problem Definition** ✅
   - Clear problem statement with user context
   - Quantified pain points (email drafts forgotten, inbox spam)
   - Validated through competitive analysis

2. **Goals & Success Metrics** ✅
   - 6 specific, measurable goals defined
   - Timeline: 4 weeks to MVP launch
   - Success metrics: 300-500 downloads Month 1, 20% D30 retention, $500 revenue Month 3

3. **User Stories** ✅
   - 31 detailed user stories across 4 epics
   - Each story includes acceptance criteria
   - Stories follow "As a... I want... So that..." format

4. **Requirements** ✅
   - 32 functional requirements (FR1-FR32)
   - 17 non-functional requirements (NFR1-NFR17)
   - Clear distinction between functional and non-functional

5. **Technical Assumptions** ✅
   - Technology stack documented (React Native, Supabase, SendGrid)
   - Third-party service limits specified
   - Platform support defined (iOS 14+, Android 8+, modern browsers)

6. **Out of Scope** ✅
   - 40+ features explicitly deferred to post-MVP
   - Clear rationale for exclusions (maintain focus, ensure launch velocity)

7. **UI/UX Design Goals** ✅
   - Design philosophy documented (Apple minimalism, Things 3 polish)
   - Key interaction paradigms defined
   - Visual language specified (color palette, typography, spacing, animations)
   - Paywall design specifications included

8. **Monetization Strategy** ✅
   - Tiered freemium launch strategy (3 phases)
   - Cohort tracking system defined
   - Grandfather status for early adopters
   - A/B pricing test ($2.99 vs $4.99)
   - Payment platform integration (Apple IAP, Google Play, Stripe)
   - Revenue projections with mitigation strategies

9. **Dependencies** ✅
   - Epic dependencies mapped (E1 → E2 → E3, E4)
   - External service dependencies documented
   - Timeline accounts for App Store approval delays

10. **Handoff Readiness** ✅
    - Next agent identified (Architect)
    - Next deliverable specified (architecture.md)
    - Handoff prompt template provided

## Key Strengths

- **Comprehensive monetization strategy**: Detailed 3-phase freemium launch with cohort tracking
- **Clear user flows**: 31 stories with specific acceptance criteria
- **Technical depth**: Database schema, API endpoints, and payment validation specified
- **Risk mitigation**: App Store fee calculations, rate limiting, deliverability monitoring
- **Design specifications**: Detailed paywall messaging, animation timings, visual language

## Architect Handoff Notes

The architect should focus on:

1. **Database schema design**: Implement `cohort`, `grandfather_status`, `trial_expires_at`, and payment tracking fields
2. **Payment validation**: Build Supabase Edge Functions for receipt validation (Apple, Google, Stripe)
3. **Cron job logic**: Email delivery scheduler with cohort and trial checks
4. **Offline-first architecture**: Local storage sync strategy for React Native and Web
5. **Paywall triggering logic**: Trial expiration, task limit, and grandfather exemption checks
