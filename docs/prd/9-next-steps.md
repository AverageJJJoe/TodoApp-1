# 9. Next Steps

## 9.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Save this PRD** as `docs/prd.md` in your TodoMorning project repository
2. **Review monetization strategy** with stakeholders (if any) to confirm tiered approach
3. **Verify domain availability** for email sending (todomorning.com or alternative)
4. **Set up project structure**:
   ```
   todomorning/
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── prd.md ✅
   │   ├── project-brief.md
   │   └── competitive-analysis.md
   ├── backend/ (Supabase project)
   ├── mobile/ (React Native app)
   └── web/ (Next.js PWA)
   ```

## 9.2 Architecture Phase Handoff

**Next Agent:** Architect (use `*agent architect` command)

**Handoff Prompt:**
```
I've completed the TodoMorning Product Requirements Document (PRD v1.1). 

Key points for architecture:
- Mobile-first React Native app (iOS/Android) + Next.js PWA
- Offline-first architecture with Supabase backend
- Tiered freemium monetization (3-phase launch, cohort tracking, grandfather status)
- Payment integration: Apple IAP, Google Play Billing, Stripe (with server-side validation)
- Email delivery system: Supabase cron job + SendGrid
- Two workflow modes: Fresh Start (reset daily) and Carry Over (task persistence)

Please create architecture.md covering:
1. System architecture diagram
2. Database schema (with monetization fields: cohort, grandfather_status, trial_expires_at, etc.)
3. API endpoints (Supabase Edge Functions for payment validation, email sending)
4. Data flow diagrams (offline sync, payment flow, email delivery)
5. Payment validation architecture (Apple/Google/Stripe receipt verification)
6. Cron job logic (email scheduler with cohort checks)
7. Security considerations (receipt validation, grandfather status enforcement)

The PRD is available at docs/prd.md. Let's build the technical foundation!
