- Proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- No hardcoded secrets
- Session validation before Supabase operations
- RLS policies handle authorization

✅ **PASS** - No new linter errors or warnings introduced.
- TypeScript linter checks passed
- No linting errors in modified files

✅ **PASS** - Code is well-commented where necessary.
- Complex logic (optimistic update, rollback) has explanatory comments
- Error handling sections documented
- No excessive comments on obvious code

## 3. Testing

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - All required unit tests as per the story and Operational Guidelines Testing Strategy are implemented.
- **Status:** N/A - Story explicitly states "Unit tests not required for MVP story (testing framework setup is Story 1.2.5, optional)"
- Story focuses on manual testing for MVP

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - All required integration tests (if applicable).
- **Status:** N/A - Not applicable for MVP story

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - All tests pass successfully.
- **Status:** Manual testing required but not executable in this environment
- **Note:** Story provides comprehensive manual test scenarios that must be executed before QA review

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Test coverage meets project standards.
- **Status:** N/A - No test coverage requirements for MVP stories

## 4. Functionality & Verification

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Functionality has been manually verified by the developer.
- **Code Logic Verified:** ✅ All code logic reviewed and verified
- **Static Analysis:** ✅ TypeScript compilation successful, no errors
- **Runtime Verification:** ⚠️ Cannot execute app in this environment - requires manual testing on device/simulator
- **Recommendation:** Manual testing must be performed following test scenarios in story before marking as "Ready for Review"

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases and potential error conditions considered and handled gracefully.
- ✅ Empty input validation (Save button disabled)
- ✅ Unchanged text validation (Save button disabled)
- ✅ Network error handling with rollback
- ✅ Task not found error handling
- ✅ No session error handling
- ✅ RLS policy violations (handled by Supabase, error caught and displayed)

## 5. Story Administration

✅ **PASS** - All tasks within the story file are marked as complete.
- All tasks and subtasks marked with [x]
- All 5 main tasks completed with all subtasks

✅ **PASS** - Clarifications or decisions documented.
- Completion notes added to Dev Agent Record
- Implementation decisions documented (optimistic update pattern, rollback pattern)

✅ **PASS** - Story wrap up section completed.
- ✅ Agent Model Used: Documented
- ✅ File List: Complete with all modified files
- ✅ Completion Notes: Detailed implementation notes
- ✅ Change Log: Updated with implementation entry

## 6. Dependencies, Build & Configuration

⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Project builds successfully without errors.
- **Status:** Cannot verify build in this environment
- **Recommendation:** Verify build with `npm start` or `expo start` before final review

✅ **PASS** - Project linting passes.
- No linter errors found in modified files
- TypeScript compilation successful

✅ **PASS** - Any new dependencies added were pre-approved.
- No new dependencies added
- All dependencies used are existing project dependencies

✅ **PASS** - No new dependencies, so no recording needed.
- No new dependencies to document

✅ **PASS** - No known security vulnerabilities.
- No new dependencies added

✅ **PASS** - No new environment variables or configurations.
- No new env vars or configs introduced

## 7. Documentation (If Applicable)

✅ **PASS** - Relevant inline code documentation complete.
- Complex logic commented (optimistic update, rollback)
- Error handling explained
- Function purpose clear from implementation

⚠️ **N/A** - User-facing documentation updated.
- **Status:** N/A - No user-facing documentation exists for MVP
- Feature is self-explanatory in UI

⚠️ **N/A** - Technical documentation updated.
- **Status:** N/A - No significant architectural changes
- Only extends existing patterns

## Final Confirmation

### Summary of Accomplishments
- ✅ Implemented `updateTask` function in task store with optimistic update and rollback pattern
- ✅ Added edit modal UI with pre-filled input and save functionality
- ✅ Made task items tappable to open edit modal
- ✅ Integrated error handling with user-friendly alerts
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Code follows established patterns and standards
- ✅ No linter errors introduced

### Items Marked as Partial/Requiring Manual Verification
1. **Manual Testing** - Cannot execute app in this environment. Story provides 8 comprehensive test scenarios that must be manually verified before final QA review.
2. **Build Verification** - Should verify project builds successfully, though no compilation errors detected.

### Technical Debt or Follow-up Work
- None identified. Implementation follows established patterns and maintains consistency.

### Challenges or Learnings
- Successfully reused existing modal styling patterns for consistency
- Optimistic update pattern matches patterns from Story 2.5 (deleteTask)
- Edit modal maintains same UX as add task modal for familiar user experience

### Story Readiness Assessment
⚠️ **Ready for Manual Testing** - Code implementation is complete and all static checks pass. Story requires manual testing following the 8 test scenarios documented in the story before being marked "Ready for Review" by QA.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with manual testing, then mark story as "Ready for Review" after all test scenarios pass.
