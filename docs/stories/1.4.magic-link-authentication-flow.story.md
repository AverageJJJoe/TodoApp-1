**so that** I can create an account without a password

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AuthScreen component with email input field
2. Email validation (basic format check)
3. "Send Magic Link" button calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()`
4. Success message shows: "Check your email"
5. Magic link email received in inbox
6. Clicking link opens app (deep link configured)

  - **Note:** Deep link handler code is complete and verified. Full E2E testing requires development build (not Expo Go limitation) or Story 1.6 Universal Links implementation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.3 completion notes]

**Key Learnings from Story 1.3:**
- Supabase client is configured in `src/lib/supabase.ts` with AsyncStorage for session persistence
- Environment variables are configured via Expo's native approach using `expo-constants` with `app.json` extra field
- Expo SDK 54 is in use with React 19 and React Native 0.81.5
- Connection to Supabase is verified and working
- Directory structure follows Expo conventions: `src/lib/` for utility/library code, `src/screens/` for screen components
- Users table exists with RLS policies enabled (users can only read/write their own row using `auth_id`)
- Test user was created in Supabase Auth (UUID: 3a25218c-64a6-4fba-8993-0784546d4663)
- RLS policies may block queries without authenticated session (expected - will be tested properly in Story 1.5 Session Management)

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/frontend-component-architecture.md, architecture/system-architecture-overview.md]

**App Navigation Structure:**
- AuthStack contains AuthScreen (shown when user is not logged in)
- AuthScreen contains EmailInput and MagicLinkVerification components
- Screens should be placed in `src/screens/` directory following Expo conventions

**UI Framework:**
- NativeWind (Tailwind CSS) is used for styling React Native components
- Follows standard React Native component patterns

**Technology Stack:**
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-rationale.md]
- React Native + Expo for cross-platform development (iOS/Android/PWA)
- Supabase for backend and authentication (magic link/passwordless)
- AsyncStorage for local storage (session persistence already configured)

### Authentication Implementation Pattern
[Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

**Magic Link Flow:**
The architecture document provides a reference implementation pattern:

```typescript
// auth/magicLink.ts (reference pattern - adapt for React Native)
async function sendMagicLink(email: string) {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
    email,
    options: {
      emailRedirectTo: `${APP_URL}/auth/callback`
    }
  })

  if (error) throw error
}

async function verifyMagicLink(token: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
    token_hash: token,
    type: 'email'
  })

  if (error) throw error
  return data
}
```

**For React Native Implementation:**
- Use `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email })` directly in the AuthScreen component
- For React Native, the `emailRedirectTo` option should use deep link format (e.g., `todotomorrow://auth/callback`)
- Supabase will automatically create user in `auth.users` table when magic link is clicked
- Session will be automatically stored in AsyncStorage (already configured in `src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Use `expo-linking` to handle deep link URLs when user clicks magic link in email

### Deep Linking Configuration
[Source: Expo documentation patterns, app.json structure]

**Expo Deep Linking Setup:**
- Install `expo-linking` package: `npx expo install expo-linking`
- Configure URL scheme in `app.json` under `expo.scheme` (e.g., `"scheme": "todotomorrow"`)
- This creates deep link format: `todotomorrow://`
- Handle deep links using `Linking.addEventListener('url', handler)` or `useEffect` with `Linking.getInitialURL()`

**Supabase Magic Link Redirect:**
- Configure redirect URL in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
- Add redirect URL: `todotomorrow://auth/callback`
- Magic link email will contain redirect to this URL
- When clicked, app opens and receives URL with token parameters

**Deep Link URL Format:**
- Supabase magic link redirects to: `todotomorrow://auth/callback?token={TOKEN_HASH}&type=email`
- Extract token from URL query parameters
- Session is automatically created by Supabase client when token is verified
- May need to call `supabase.auth.getSession()` after handling deep link to refresh session

### Email Validation Pattern
[Source: Common React Native patterns]

**Basic Email Validation:**
- Use regex pattern for email format validation
- Pattern example: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- Validate on input blur or button click
- Show error message if email format is invalid
- Note: This is basic client-side validation - Supabase will also validate on server

### Component Structure
[Source: architecture/frontend-component-architecture.md, Story 1.1, Story 1.2]

**File Location:**
- Create `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`
- Follow standard Expo project structure: source code in `src/` directory
- Screens in `src/screens/` subdirectory

**Component Pattern:**
- Use functional component with React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Import supabase client: `import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase'`
- Use React Native components: `View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `TouchableOpacity` or `Pressable`, `ActivityIndicator` (for loading states)
- Use NativeWind classes for styling (if configured) or StyleSheet API

**State Management:**
- Local component state for email input, loading state, success/error messages
- Session state will be managed in Story 1.5 (Session Management - Zustand store)
- For this story, focus on sending magic link and handling deep link callback

### Supabase Authentication Flow
[Source: Supabase documentation patterns, architecture/security-privacy.md]

**SignInWithOtp API:**
- Method: `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email, options? })`
- Options can include `emailRedirectTo` for custom redirect URL
- Returns `{ data, error }` - check for errors
- Success means email was sent (user may or may not exist - Supabase handles both signup and signin)

**Session Management:**
- Supabase client automatically handles session storage via AsyncStorage (configured in `src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- After magic link is clicked and verified, session is automatically created
- Session can be accessed via `supabase.auth.getSession()` or `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`
- Session management UI (checking for existing session, navigating based on auth state) will be implemented in Story 1.5 (Session Management)

**User Record Creation:**
- When user clicks magic link for first time, Supabase Auth automatically creates record in `auth.users` table
- User profile record in `users` table will be created in later story (via trigger or Edge Function)
- For this story, focus on authentication flow only

### Project Structure Notes
[Source: Story 1.1, Story 1.2, Story 1.3]

**Directory Structure:**
- Source code: `src/`
- Screens: `src/screens/`
- Library/utilities: `src/lib/`
- Types: `src/types/`

**Configuration Files:**
- `app.json` - Expo configuration (add deep link scheme here)
- `package.json` - Dependencies (add `expo-linking` if needed)

**Supabase Configuration:**
- Supabase client: `src/lib/supabase.ts` (already configured)
- Supabase Dashboard: Configure email redirect URLs in Authentication settings

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing for authentication flow (end-to-end)
- Test on iOS simulator and Android emulator
- Test deep link handling on both platforms

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Enter invalid email format → Should show validation error
2. Enter valid email → Click "Send Magic Link" → Should show success message
3. Check email inbox → Should receive magic link email
4. Click magic link in email → App should open (if installed) or redirect to app store (if not installed)
5. After clicking link → Session should be created automatically
6. Verify session exists: Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users (should see new user)

**Email Testing:**
- Supabase provides test emails in development
- Magic link emails are sent by Supabase (no additional email service configuration needed for this story)
- In production, email templates can be customized in Supabase Dashboard

**Deep Link Testing:**
- Test deep link by manually constructing URL: `todotomorrow://auth/callback?token=test`
- Use `adb` command for Android: `adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "todotomorrow://auth/callback"`
- Use iOS simulator: `xcrun simctl openurl booted "todotomorrow://auth/callback"`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/technology-stack-rationale.md, Story 1.1, Story 1.2]

- Must use React Native + Expo (no native code)
- Must use Supabase Auth API (`signInWithOtp`)
- Must use AsyncStorage for session persistence (already configured in Supabase client)
- Deep links must work on iOS, Android, and PWA platforms
- Email validation is basic client-side only - Supabase will do server-side validation
- Magic link expiration: Supabase default is 1 hour (configurable in Dashboard)

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

**Authentication Security:**
- All API calls use HTTPS/TLS 1.3 (handled by Supabase)
- Magic links expire after set time (default 1 hour)
- Tokens are single-use (cannot be reused after verification)
- Email verification ensures user owns the email address

**Data Protection:**
- User email is sent to Supabase over HTTPS
- Session tokens stored securely in AsyncStorage
- RLS policies (from Story 1.3) will protect user data after authentication

### Known Limitations / Future Enhancements
- User profile record in `users` table will be created in later story (not part of this story)
- Session management UI (checking for existing session, navigation) will be implemented in Story 1.5 (Session Management)
- Email templates customization can be done in Supabase Dashboard (future enhancement)
- Password-based authentication is not part of MVP (magic link only)

## Testing
**Manual Test Steps:**
1. Open app → Should show AuthScreen (for now, manually navigate to it - navigation will be handled in Story 1.5 Session Management)
2. Enter invalid email (e.g., "notanemail") → Click "Send Magic Link" → Should show validation error
3. Enter valid email → Click "Send Magic Link" → Should show "Check your email" message
4. Check email inbox → Should receive magic link email from Supabase
5. Click magic link in email → App should open (if installed) or show app store link (if not installed)
6. After app opens → Verify session was created (can check via Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users)
7. Test deep link manually using platform-specific commands (see Dev Notes above)

**Success Criteria:**
- Email input field accepts input and validates format
- Magic link email is received within seconds
- Clicking magic link opens app successfully
- Session is created after magic link verification
- Error messages display appropriately for invalid inputs or network errors

- [x] Verified security considerations are addressed
- [ ] **Recommendation:** Consider adding automated unit tests for email validation regex
- [ ] **Recommendation:** During implementation, document any platform-specific deep linking quirks discovered
- [ ] **Recommendation:** Verify Supabase email template customization options for production

### Security Review

**Status:** PASS (with considerations)

**Findings:**
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS 1.3 enforced by Supabase (architectural choice)
- ✅ Magic link expiration documented (default 1 hour, configurable)
- ✅ Single-use tokens prevent replay attacks (Supabase handles this)
- ✅ Email verification ensures user owns email address
- ✅ Session storage uses AsyncStorage (secure for mobile apps)
- ⚠️ **Consideration:** Rate limiting on magic link requests should be handled by Supabase (verify in Dashboard settings)
- ⚠️ **Consideration:** Deep link URL validation should verify token format before processing
- ⚠️ **Consideration:** Error messages should not reveal whether email exists in system (security best practice)

**Security Best Practices Observed:**
- Passwordless authentication reduces password-related security risks
- Magic links are time-limited (expiration)
- Tokens are single-use (prevents replay)
- HTTPS ensures encrypted communication

**Risk Level:** Medium - Authentication is security-critical, but Supabase handles many security concerns. Main risks are:
1. Rate limiting (should verify Supabase handles this)
2. Deep link URL validation (must be implemented correctly)
3. Error message information disclosure (should follow security best practices)

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS

- ✅ Magic link API call is lightweight (single HTTP request)
- ✅ Email delivery is handled by Supabase (no app performance impact)
- ✅ Deep link handling is native platform functionality (efficient)
- ✅ No performance concerns identified for MVP scale
- ✅ Session storage in AsyncStorage is performant for this use case

- **Given:** User successfully requested magic link
- **When:** Supabase sends email
- **Then:** Email is received in user's inbox with magic link
- **Test Evidence:** Manual email inbox check, email content verification

**AC 6: Deep Link Opens App**
- **Given:** User received magic link email and app is configured with deep linking
- **When:** User clicks magic link in email
- **Then:** App opens and handles deep link URL with token
- **Test Evidence:** Manual test on iOS/Android/PWA, deep link URL parsing verification, session creation verification

**Coverage Summary:** All 6 acceptance criteria have clear test mappings. AC 5 and AC 6 require manual testing due to email delivery and platform-specific deep linking behavior.

### Technical Debt Identification

**No Technical Debt Identified at Draft Stage:**
- Story is well-structured with clear boundaries
- All requirements are clearly defined
- Security considerations are addressed
- Testing approach is appropriate

**Future Considerations (Not Debt):**
- Automated email delivery testing would require email service mocking (future enhancement)
- Deep link testing automation could be improved with E2E testing framework (future enhancement)
- Rate limiting verification should be confirmed during implementation (Supabase Dashboard check)

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified - this is a pre-implementation review of the story draft.

### Post-Implementation Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** Excellent implementation quality with production-ready code structure. The authentication flow is correctly implemented with comprehensive error handling and security best practices. Code demonstrates understanding of React Native patterns and Supabase authentication. Known limitations (Expo Go custom scheme support, Supabase redirect behavior) are well-documented and have mitigation plans via Story 1.6 (Universal Links).

**Implementation Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean, well-structured component architecture
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- ✅ Security best practices followed (no email existence disclosure)
- ✅ Robust deep link handler supporting multiple token types (`email`, `signup`, `magiclink`)
- ✅ Excellent debug logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Proper async/await error handling
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Loading states properly managed
- ✅ Input validation with clear feedback

### Code Quality Assessment

**Architecture & Design:**
- ✅ Follows React Native best practices (functional components, hooks)
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns (validation, API calls, UI)
- ✅ Clean component structure matches architecture guidelines
- ✅ No code duplication identified
- ✅ TypeScript types properly used

**Code Review Findings:**

**Strengths:**
1. **Deep Link Handler Robustness:**
   - Handles multiple URL path formats (`auth/callback`, includes check)
   - Supports multiple token types (`email`, `signup`, `magiclink`)
   - Fallback verification attempt for `magiclink` type (good defensive coding)
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Network errors caught and handled gracefully
   - Expired token errors display user-friendly messages
   - Token missing/type mismatch handled appropriately
   - No unhandled promise rejections

3. **Security:**
   - Generic error messages don't reveal email existence (security best practice)
   - Email validation prevents invalid submissions
   - Token verification handled securely via Supabase
   - No sensitive data logged inappropriately

4. **User Experience:**
   - Clear validation feedback
   - Loading states prevent double submissions
   - Success messages confirm actions
   - Error messages are actionable

**Minor Improvements Identified:**

1. **Test Button (Production Cleanup Required):**
   - Test button (`🧪 Test Deep Link Handler`) should be removed before production
   - Currently serves development/testing purpose (acceptable for MVP)
   - Marked with TODO comment (good practice)

2. **Email Validation Regex:**
   - Current regex: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
   - Acceptable for MVP but basic (doesn't catch all edge cases)
   - Supabase does server-side validation (backup)
   - Consideration: Could be extracted to utility function for reusability

3. **Console Logs:**
   - Debug logs use emoji markers (good for filtering)
   - Should be removed or gated behind `__DEV__` flag before production
   - Current approach acceptable for development

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring required** - Code quality is production-ready. Minor improvements identified are low priority and don't block completion.

**Recommendations for Future Enhancements:**
- Extract email validation to utility function if used elsewhere
- Gate debug console.logs behind `__DEV__` for production builds

- [ ] **Future:** Implement Universal Links (Story 1.6) for production reliability

### Security Review

**Status:** PASS

**Findings:**
- ✅ Generic error messages (no email existence disclosure) - Line 179: `'Unable to send magic link. Please try again.'`
- ✅ Input validation prevents malicious input
- ✅ Token verification via Supabase (secure server-side validation)
- ✅ Session stored securely in AsyncStorage (configured in supabase.ts)
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS enforced by Supabase
- ✅ Magic links expire after 1 hour (Supabase default)
- ✅ Single-use tokens (Supabase handles)
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs (only debug markers)

**Security Best Practices Observed:**
- Error messages don't reveal system state
- Input sanitization via `.trim()` on email
- Secure token verification flow
- No client-side token storage (handled by Supabase client)

**Recommendations:**
- ⚠️ Verify Supabase Dashboard rate limiting is configured (external to code)
- ✅ Consider rate limiting UI feedback if multiple rapid requests detected (future enhancement)

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS

**Assessment:**
- ✅ Single HTTP request per magic link send (lightweight)
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders (proper state management)
- ✅ Deep link handler is async and non-blocking
- ✅ Session storage in AsyncStorage is performant
- ✅ No performance bottlenecks identified
- ✅ Code structure supports scalability

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability:** ✅ HIGH
- Email input: Fully controllable (test any email format)
- API calls: Mockable via Supabase client (testable in unit tests)
- Deep link handler: Testable via test button (development) or manual deep links
- Error scenarios: All error paths testable

**Observability:** ✅ HIGH
- UI states: Fully observable (loading, success, error messages)
- API responses: Observable via console logs and error messages
- Deep link processing: Comprehensive debug logging
- Session state: Observable via Supabase Dashboard or `getSession()`

**Debuggability:** ✅ HIGH

### Requirements Traceability

**AC 1: AuthScreen Component with Email Input** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Evidence:** `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx` exists with email TextInput component
- **Test Evidence:** Visual inspection confirmed, component renders correctly

**AC 2: Email Validation** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Evidence:** Regex validation at line 21, validation function at line 146, error display at line 217
- **Test Evidence:** Invalid emails rejected with error message, valid emails pass

**AC 3: Send Magic Link Button Calls API** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Evidence:** `handleSendMagicLink` function at line 150 calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp()` at line 170
- **Test Evidence:** Console logs confirm API call, Supabase Dashboard shows request

**AC 4: Success Message Display** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Evidence:** Success message state at line 17, displayed at line 220, set at line 182
- **Test Evidence:** "Check your email" message appears after successful API call

**AC 5: Magic Link Email Received** ✅ VERIFIED
- **Evidence:** Emails delivered by Supabase, verified via manual testing
- **Test Evidence:** Emails received in inbox with correct format

**AC 6: Deep Link Opens App** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Evidence:** Deep link handler fully implemented (lines 45-144), code works correctly
- **Limitation:** Cannot be fully tested in Expo Go (known limitation)
- **Mitigation:** Test button verifies handler logic, Story 1.6 (Universal Links) addresses production needs
- **Test Evidence:** Handler processes deep links correctly via test button, logs confirm proper operation

**Coverage Summary:** 5/6 ACs fully implemented and testable. AC 6 has code complete but testing limited by environment (documented limitation with mitigation plan).

### Technical Debt Identification

**No Critical Technical Debt:**
- Code structure is clean and maintainable
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Security practices followed
- No shortcuts or workarounds that compromise quality

**Documented Limitations (Not Debt):**
- Expo Go custom scheme limitation (expected behavior, documented)
- Supabase redirect white screen (known issue, addressed by Story 1.6 Universal Links)
- Manual testing required (acceptable for MVP given email delivery nature)

**Pre-Production Cleanup Required:**
- Test button should be removed (line 244-262)
- Debug console.logs should be gated behind `__DEV__` flag

**Future Enhancements (Not Debt):**
- Universal Links implementation (Story 1.6 planned)
- Unit tests for email validation (optional, low priority)
- Rate limiting UI feedback (enhancement)

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during this review. All code quality observations and recommendations documented above.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → `docs/qa/gates/1.4-magic-link-authentication-flow.yml`

**Quality Score:** 85/100

**Rationale:**
- Code implementation is excellent and production-ready
- All core acceptance criteria implemented correctly
- Security best practices followed
- Minor deduction (-5 points): Test button present (needs removal before production)
- Minor deduction (-10 points): Full E2E testing blocked by Expo Go limitation (documented and mitigated)
- Known limitations have clear mitigation paths (Story 1.6 Universal Links)

**Summary:**
Implementation quality is excellent with production-ready code. All core functionality works correctly. The CONCERNS gate reflects documented limitations (Expo Go testing, Supabase redirect) which are acknowledged and have mitigation plans. Code itself is correct and will work in production builds. Pre-production cleanup (test button removal) is minor and doesn't block completion.

**Final Assessment: READY**

**Summary:**
- **Story Readiness:** READY for implementation
- **Clarity Score:** 9/10
- **Major Gaps:** None identified

**Developer Perspective:**
- ✅ Story provides sufficient context to implement magic link authentication flow
- ✅ Complete technical details included: API calls, deep linking setup, component structure
- ✅ Code examples provided for magic link pattern (adapted from architecture docs)
- ✅ Deep linking configuration clearly explained with platform-specific details
- ✅ Testing approach is comprehensive with platform-specific commands
