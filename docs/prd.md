## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals

1. **Launch MVP in 4 weeks** - Ship functional PWA + native apps (if approved) by Week 4
2. **Validate product-market fit** - Achieve 300-500 downloads in Month 1 with 20% Day-30 retention
3. **Generate early revenue** - Reach $500 cumulative net revenue by Month 3 via tiered freemium strategy
4. **Build organic audience** - Grow X (Twitter) following through build-in-public strategy (50-100 engaged followers)
5. **Establish competitive positioning** - Position as "the anti-Todoist" for simplicity-seeking email users
6. **Prove monetization model** - Validate tiered pricing ($2.99 vs $4.99) converts at 10-12%+ rate
7. **Maximize adoption through free launch** - Remove price friction at launch, then introduce freemium in Phase 2

### 1.2 Background Context

TodoTomorrow solves a problem experienced by email-native knowledge workers: capturing sporadic evening brain dumps without cluttering their inbox or requiring manual intervention.

**The Problem:** During busy reactive daytimes, there's no time for planning. But during evenings (bed, car, waiting for kids), strategic ideas for tomorrow surface sporadically. Existing solutions fail:
- **Email drafts** - Users forget to send them, tasks never arrive in morning inbox
- **Todoist** - Too complex with overwhelming features, clutters inbox with individual reminder emails
- **TodoMailer** - Sends one email per task immediately, creating inbox spam

**The Solution:** TodoTomorrow is a mobile-first capture tool that automatically batches evening brain dumps into one clean morning email at the user's chosen time (default 6:00 AM), delivering a consolidated daily action plan directly to their inbox.

**Why This Matters:** Email remains the universal productivity hub for knowledge workers. The app doesn't try to replace email—it bridges mobile capture to email delivery. Competitive analysis reveals no existing solution offers automatic batched email delivery, creating a genuine blue ocean opportunity.

**Strategic Context:** This indie maker project targets a niche within the $50B+ productivity software market. Success is defined as sustainable solo-dev income ($500-2000/month), validated through X build-in-public strategy and Product Hunt launch.

### 1.3 Monetization Strategy Overview

TodoTomorrow uses a **tiered freemium launch strategy** to maximize adoption first, then capture revenue through data-driven pricing:

**Phase 1 (Weeks 4-6):** Launch completely FREE
- Remove all payment friction
- Build habit formation in first users
- Create testimonial cohort (grandfather'd forever)
- Target: 200-300 downloads

**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-8, Month 2):** Introduce freemium with A/B pricing test
- New users: 30-day trial, then $2.99 OR $4.99 (50/50 split)
- Early adopters: Stay free forever (grandfather status)
- Test which price point drives higher conversion
- Target: 10-12% conversion rate

**Phase 3 (Month 3+):** Scale with winning price
- Implement winner from Phase 2 test
- Sustain 12%+ conversion rate
- Optional: Test $5.99 if conversion stays strong
- Target: $500+ net revenue by Month 3

**Cohort Strategy:**
- `free_launch`: Early adopters, never charged (Weeks 4-6)
- `early_freemium_2.99`: Phase 2 test group at $2.99
- `early_freemium_4.99`: Phase 2 test group at $4.99
- `paid_cohort_v1`: Phase 3+ users at winning price

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### 3.1 Overall UX Vision

TodoTomorrow embraces Apple's design philosophy: radical simplicity with obsessive attention to detail. The interface should feel native, polished, and invisible - users capture thoughts with zero friction, then forget about the app until the next evening.

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Apple Minimalism**: Clean white space, subtle shadows, native feel
- **Things 3 Polish**: Delightful micro-interactions, considered typography
- **Speed Over Features**: Task creation in 2 taps maximum
- **Invisible When Right**: Best UX is when users don't notice the app

**Inspiration (DO THIS):**
- ✅ Apple Reminders: Simplicity, system font usage, native patterns
- ✅ Things 3: Polish, animations, "Today" view philosophy
- ✅ Clear app: Gesture-based, minimal chrome

**Anti-Inspiration (DON'T DO THIS):**
- ❌ Todoist: Feature density, overwhelming options
- ❌ Any.do: Over-animated, too many colors
- ❌ Microsoft To Do: Generic, cluttered

### 3.2 Key Interaction Paradigms

**Primary Interaction Flow:**
1. User opens app → Already on main screen (no navigation)
2. Taps floating "+" button (Apple-style FAB, bottom-right)
3. Types task → Taps "Add" (or Enter key)
4. Task appears instantly with subtle slide-in animation
5. Repeat throughout evening
6. Close app → Forget until tomorrow

**Completion Flow (Carry Over Mode):**
1. User taps checkbox next to completed task
2. Haptic feedback (light impact)
3. Strike-through animation (200ms)
4. Fade out (200ms)
5. Slide out and collapse (200ms)
6. Task moves to Archive tab

**Paywall Interaction Flow:**
1. **Trial Active (Days 1-26):** Subtle banner in Settings: "X days remaining"
2. **Trial Ending (Days 27-29):** Prominent modal on app open (dismissible)
3. **Trial Expired (Day 30+):** Hard paywall (non-dismissible, must choose action)
4. **Free Launch Cohort:** Optional support prompt (always dismissible, shown once post-Day 30)

### 3.3 Visual Language

**Color Palette:**
- Primary Blue: `#007AFF` (iOS system blue)
- Success Green: `#34C759` (iOS system green)
- Warning Orange: `#FF9500` (iOS system orange)
- Text Primary: `#000000` (pure black on white background)
- Text Secondary: `#8E8E93` (iOS secondary label)
- Background: `#FFFFFF` (pure white)
- Card Background: `#F2F2F7` (iOS system gray 6)

**Typography:**
- Primary: SF Pro Display (iOS), Roboto (Android), system font (Web)
- Task Text: 17pt regular
- Date Labels: 13pt regular
- Section Headers: 20pt semibold
- Buttons: 17pt semibold

**Spacing System:**

- Common spacing: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px
- Screen margins: 16px (mobile), 24px (tablet)
- Task item padding: 16px vertical, 16px horizontal

### 3.4 Animation Principles

**Task Creation:**
- Slide in from bottom with spring animation (duration: 300ms)
- Cubic bezier easing: `(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)`

**Task Completion:**
- Strike-through: 200ms linear
- Fade: 200ms ease-out
- Slide out: 200ms ease-in
- Total: 600ms

**Paywall Modal:**
- Fade in backdrop: 200ms ease-out
- Slide in from bottom: 300ms spring
- On dismiss: Reverse animations

**General Rules:**
- Never animate longer than 600ms
- Use spring animations for natural feel
- Haptic feedback on state changes
- No animations longer than 2 steps

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1 Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React Native (Expo) for native iOS/Android apps
- React (Next.js) for Progressive Web App (PWA)
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Native Gesture Handler for animations

**Backend:**
- Supabase for authentication, database, and serverless functions
- PostgreSQL database (Supabase-managed)
- Supabase Edge Functions for payment validation and email triggers

**Email Delivery:**
- SendGrid for transactional email sending
- Custom SMTP relay via Supabase Edge Functions

**Payment Processing:**
- Apple In-App Purchase (iOS)
- Google Play Billing (Android)
- Stripe (Web/PWA)
- Server-side receipt validation for all platforms

**Hosting:**
- Vercel for PWA hosting
- Apple App Store for iOS distribution
- Google Play Store for Android distribution

### 4.2 Third-Party Services

| Service | Purpose | Free Tier Limit | Cost After |
|---------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Supabase | Auth, DB, Edge Functions | 500 MB DB, 2 GB bandwidth | $25/mo |
| SendGrid | Email delivery | 100 emails/day | $19.95/mo for 40k |
| Vercel | PWA hosting | 100 GB bandwidth | $20/mo Pro |
| Apple Developer | App Store | N/A | $99/year |
| Google Play | Play Store | N/A | $25 one-time |
| Stripe | Web payments | No monthly fee | 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction |

**App Store Fees:**
- Apple IAP: 30% commission on all transactions
- Google Play: 30% commission on all transactions
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Pricing Impact:**
- $2.99 sale → $2.09 net (Apple/Google) or $2.60 net (Stripe)
- $4.99 sale → $3.49 net (Apple/Google) or $4.54 net (Stripe)

### 4.3 Development Environment

**IDE:** Cursor AI with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (agentic coding assistant)

**Version Control:** Git + GitHub

**Local Development:**
- Node.js 20+
- Expo CLI for React Native
- Supabase local development (Docker)

**Testing:**
- Jest for unit tests
- React Native Testing Library
- Expo Go for device testing
- TestFlight (iOS) and Internal Testing (Android) for beta

### 4.4 Platform Support

**Mobile:**
- iOS 14.0+ (React Native requirement)
- Android 8.0+ (API level 26+)

**Web:**
- Chrome 90+
- Safari 14+
- Firefox 88+
- Edge 90+

**PWA Features:**
- Installable to home screen
- Offline functionality (service worker)
- Push notifications (future consideration)

### 4.5 Assumptions

1. **Development velocity:** With Cursor AI, 1 developer can complete 15-20 hours of work per week
2. **App Store approval:** iOS and Android approvals will take 2-3 days (not blocking launch)
3. **Email deliverability:** SendGrid will achieve 95%+ inbox placement with proper domain configuration
4. **Payment integration:** Supabase Edge Functions can handle receipt validation for all 3 platforms
5. **User cohort assignment:** Cohort assignment happens on signup and never changes
6. **Trial tracking:** Trial expiration is based on `created_at` timestamp, not first task creation
7. **Grandfather enforcement:** `free_launch` cohort check happens on every paywall trigger
8. **Analytics:** Basic analytics via Supabase (queries on users table) sufficient for MVP

---

## 5. Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP

The following features are intentionally excluded from the 4-week MVP to maintain focus and ensure launch velocity:

### 5.1 Features Deferred to Post-MVP

**Task Management:**
- ❌ Subtasks or nested tasks
- ❌ Task notes or descriptions beyond title
- ❌ Task tags or labels
- ❌ Task search functionality
- ❌ Bulk task operations (select all, delete all)
- ❌ Task templates or recurring tasks
- ❌ Task reordering (drag and drop)

**Collaboration:**
- ❌ Shared tasks with other users
- ❌ Team workspaces
- ❌ Comments or collaboration features
- ❌ Assigning tasks to others

**Advanced Email Features:**

## 8. Development Guidelines - NEW SECTION

### Story Size Principles

**Every story should be:**
- ✅ Completable in 2-4 hours (not 8+ hours)
- ✅ Testable immediately after completion
- ✅ Building directly on previous story
- ✅ Single clear deliverable

**Red Flags (Story Too Big):**
- ❌ Multiple database tables in one story
- ❌ More than 8 acceptance criteria
- ❌ "And also..." appearing in story description
- ❌ Multiple integration points (auth + tasks + emails in one story)
- ❌ Cannot test without completing other stories first

### Build-Test-Fix Workflow

After each story:

1. **Build:** Implement the story
2. **Test:** Verify acceptance criteria (all should pass)
3. **Fix:** If issues found, fix before moving to next story
4. **Commit:** Git commit with story ID (e.g., "Story 1.3: Database schema - Users table")
5. **Next:** Only then move to next story

**Never move forward if current story has failing tests.**

### Story Dependencies

Stories are **intentionally sequential**. Do not skip ahead.

Example: You cannot do Story 2.3 (Save to Supabase) without Story 2.2 (Local state) working first.

If a story is blocked:
1. Check if previous story is actually complete (all ACs passing)
2. If previous story incomplete → Go back and fix it
3. If blocked by external factor (e.g., waiting for Stripe approval) → Mark story as "Blocked" and work on different epic temporarily

### Testing Each Story

**Minimum test for each story:**
- Unit test (if business logic exists)
- Manual test following the "Test:" line in each story
- Verify acceptance criteria manually

**Do not proceed if:**
- Story's "Test:" step fails
- Any acceptance criteria not met
- Code has obvious bugs or crashes

### Key Strengths

- **Comprehensive monetization strategy**: Detailed 3-phase freemium launch with cohort tracking
- **Clear user flows**: 31 stories with specific acceptance criteria
- **Technical depth**: Database schema, API endpoints, and payment validation specified
- **Risk mitigation**: App Store fee calculations, rate limiting, deliverability monitoring
- **Design specifications**: Detailed paywall messaging, animation timings, visual language

### Architect Handoff Notes

The architect should focus on:

1. **Database schema design**: Implement `cohort`, `grandfather_status`, `trial_expires_at`, and payment tracking fields
2. **Payment validation**: Build Supabase Edge Functions for receipt validation (Apple, Google, Stripe)
3. **Cron job logic**: Email delivery scheduler with cohort and trial checks
4. **Offline-first architecture**: Local storage sync strategy for React Native and Web
5. **Paywall triggering logic**: Trial expiration, task limit, and grandfather exemption checks

## 9. Next Steps

### 9.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Save this PRD** as `docs/prd.md` in your TodoTomorrow project repository
2. **Review monetization strategy** with stakeholders (if any) to confirm tiered approach
3. **Verify domain availability** for email sending (todotomorrow.com or alternative)
4. **Set up project structure**:
   ```
   todotomorrow/
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── prd.md ✅
   │   ├── project-brief.md
   │   └── competitive-analysis.md
   ├── backend/ (Supabase project)
   ├── mobile/ (React Native app)
   └── web/ (Next.js PWA)
   ```

### 9.2 Architecture Phase Handoff

**Next Agent:** Architect (use `*agent architect` command)

**Handoff Prompt:**
```
I've completed the TodoTomorrow Product Requirements Document (PRD v1.1). 

Key points for architecture:
- Mobile-first React Native app (iOS/Android) + Next.js PWA
- Offline-first architecture with Supabase backend
- Tiered freemium monetization (3-phase launch, cohort tracking, grandfather status)
- Payment integration: Apple IAP, Google Play Billing, Stripe (with server-side validation)
- Email delivery system: Supabase cron job + SendGrid
- Two workflow modes: Fresh Start (reset daily) and Carry Over (task persistence)

Please create architecture.md covering:
1. System architecture diagram
2. Database schema (with monetization fields: cohort, grandfather_status, trial_expires_at, etc.)
3. API endpoints (Supabase Edge Functions for payment validation, email sending)
4. Data flow diagrams (offline sync, payment flow, email delivery)
5. Payment validation architecture (Apple/Google/Stripe receipt verification)
6. Cron job logic (email scheduler with cohort checks)
7. Security considerations (receipt validation, grandfather status enforcement)

The PRD is available at docs/prd.md. Let's build the technical foundation!
```

5. Banner persists at top: "⚠️ 3 days remaining"
6. Day 29: Banner updates to "⚠️ Trial ends tomorrow"
7. Day 30: Hard paywall (non-dismissible)
8. User must choose:
   - **Option A:** Tap "Unlock Premium" → Payment flow → Premium unlocked
   - **Option B:** Tap "Use Free Tier (50 tasks/month)" → Downgraded to limited tier
9. If Option A: Receipt validated server-side → `is_paid = true` → Paywall dismisses
10. If Option B: User continues with 50 tasks/month soft cap, weekly paywall reminder

### Flow 4: Payment Flow (iOS)
1. User taps "Unlock Premium" button
2. App checks cohort → Shows appropriate IAP product ($2.99 or $4.99)
