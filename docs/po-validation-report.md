## CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES

### ✅ **RESOLVED - Critical Issues Fixed**

**1. Database Schema Discrepancy** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Resolution Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Action Taken:** Created unified schema combining both documents
- **Files Updated:** 
  - `docs/architecture.md` - Updated with all monetization fields
  - `docs/prd.md` Appendix B - Updated to match unified schema
  - Stories 1.3, 2.1, 2.3, 2.6, 5.3 - Updated to reference correct fields
- **Result:** Single source of truth established in `docs/architecture.md` Section 3
- **Summary:** See `docs/schema-alignment-summary.md` for complete details

### ✅ **RESOLVED - Quality Improvements**

**2. Testing Framework Setup Story** ✅ **ADDED**
- **Resolution Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Action Taken:** Created Story 1.2.5: Testing Framework Setup
- **Location:** PRD Epic 1, after Story 1.2
- **Includes:** Jest, React Native Testing Library, test directory structure, example test
- **Result:** Testing infrastructure established early (before Story 2.1)

**3. CI/CD Pipeline Not Explicitly Defined**
- **Location:** Section 2.3 (Deployment Pipeline)
- **Issue:** Deployment strategy mentions Vercel but no CI/CD setup story
- **Impact:** Deployment may be manual or inconsistent
- **Recommendation:** Add CI/CD setup story to Epic 1 or Epic 4 before deployment week

**4. Accessibility Requirements Lack Detail**
- **Location:** PRD Section 3.1 (UI Design Goals), Section 8.2 (User Journey Completeness)
- **Issue:** Accessibility mentioned but no specific requirements (WCAG level, screen reader support, etc.)
- **Impact:** Accessibility may be overlooked during development
- **Recommendation:** Add accessibility checklist to PRD Section 3.1 with specific requirements

---
