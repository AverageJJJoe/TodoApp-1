# Fix Instructions - App Not Loading

## ‚úÖ What I Just Fixed:

1. **Reinstalled `expo-linking`** - This should resolve the module not found error
2. **Cleared all caches** - Metro bundler cache, npm cache, etc.
3. **Made assets optional** - Temporarily removed asset file requirements from `app.json` so the app can run without icon/splash images

## üöÄ Now Do This:

### Step 1: Stop Your Current Expo Server
If Expo is still running, press **`Ctrl+C`** in the terminal to stop it.

### Step 2: Start Expo Again (with clean cache)
```powershell
npx expo start -c
```

The `-c` flag clears the cache. This should now work!

### Step 3: Test the App
- **On Phone:** Scan the QR code with Expo Go app
- **On iOS Simulator:** Press `i` in the Expo terminal
- **On Android Emulator:** Press `a` in the Expo terminal

## üîç If It Still Doesn't Work:

### Option A: Full Clean Restart
```powershell
# Stop Expo (Ctrl+C if running)

# Clear everything
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .expo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Restart
npx expo start -c
```

### Option B: Reinstall All Dependencies
```powershell
# Stop Expo (Ctrl+C if running)

# Remove and reinstall
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
npm install

# Start fresh
npx expo start -c
```

## üìù Notes:

1. **Assets are now optional** - The app will run without icon/splash images. For production, you'll want to add proper assets later, but for development/testing, this is fine.

2. **Supabase is configured** ‚úÖ - I can see from your screenshot that you've correctly added `todotomorrow://auth/callback` to Supabase redirect URLs. Great job!

3. **expo-linking is installed** ‚úÖ - The package is now properly installed and should be recognized.

---

## ‚ú® Expected Result:

After running `npx expo start -c`, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No "Unable to resolve expo-linking" error
- ‚úÖ No "Unable to resolve asset" errors  
- ‚úÖ QR code appears
- ‚úÖ App loads successfully showing the AuthScreen with email input

If you see any other errors, share them and I'll help fix them!
