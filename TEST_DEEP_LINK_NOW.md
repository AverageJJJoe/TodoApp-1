# Test Deep Link Directly - Right Now

## The Problem

Supabase's redirect page (`https://...verify?...`) shows a white screen instead of redirecting. This is a Supabase issue, not our code.

## ✅ Solution: Test Deep Link Handler Directly

Let's bypass Supabase's broken redirect and test our handler directly.

### Step 1: Extract Token from Your Email

From your latest email link, the token is:
```
c5edb72ca94c8eb95d18672da27bb4971ffd2dd97384f89cb752168e
```

### Step 2: Test on Your Phone (Where Expo Go is Running)

**On your phone, open Chrome browser and type this EXACTLY:**

```
todotomorrow://auth/callback?token=c5edb72ca94c8eb95d18672da27bb4971ffd2dd97384f89cb752168e&type=magiclink
```

Then press **Go/Enter**.

### Step 3: What Should Happen

1. **Chrome should show:** "Open in Expo Go?" or similar prompt
2. **Click "Open"**
3. **Expo Go should open** (or switch to it if already open)
4. **Check the Expo terminal on your PC** - you should see debug logs:
   ```
   🔗 Deep link received: todotomorrow://auth/callback?token=...
   📦 Parsed URL: {...}
   🔑 Query params: {...}
   🎫 Token: Found Type: magiclink
   ✅ Processing authentication...
   🔐 Verifying OTP with type: email
   ```

### Step 4: Check Result in App

**In Expo Go app, you should see:**
- ✅ "Successfully signed in!" message
- OR an error message (but we'll know what went wrong)

## Why This Works

- Bypasses Supabase's broken redirect page
- Tests our deep link handler directly
- Verifies token verification works
- Confirms session creation

## If This Works

Great! Our code works. The issue is just Supabase's redirect page. We can:
1. Work around it (users manually copy tokens - not ideal)
2. Or fix Supabase's redirect configuration
3. Or implement an alternative flow

## If This Doesn't Work

Share:
1. What happens when you type the URL?
2. Do you see the "Open in Expo Go?" prompt?
3. What appears in the Expo terminal logs?
4. What message appears in the app?

Try this now and let me know what happens!
