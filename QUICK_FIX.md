# Quick Fix for App Not Loading

## Problem 1: expo-linking not found
Even though `expo-linking` is installed, Metro bundler can't find it. This is a cache issue.

## Problem 2: Missing assets
The app.json references asset files that don't exist yet (for development, this can be ignored temporarily).

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Stop the Expo server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where Expo is running to stop it.

### Step 2: Clear all caches
Run these commands one by one in PowerShell:

```powershell
# Clear Metro bundler cache
cd "C:\Users\joega\My Apps\todoapp"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .expo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules\.cache -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Clear watchman cache (if you have watchman installed)
watchman watch-del-all

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force
```

### Step 3: Reinstall expo-linking
```powershell
npm uninstall expo-linking
npm install expo-linking --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Step 4: Start Expo with clean cache
```powershell
npx expo start -c
```

The `-c` flag clears the cache automatically.

## Alternative: Quick Fix for Missing Assets (Temporary)

If assets are still causing issues, you can temporarily make them optional by modifying `app.json`:

You can comment out or remove the asset references temporarily for development:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    // ... other config ...
    // Temporarily comment out icon if missing:
    // "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
    "splash": {
      // "image": "./assets/splash.png",  // Temporarily commented
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
    }
    // ... rest of config
  }
}
```

**Note:** For production, you'll need proper asset files. But for development/testing, this workaround lets you proceed.
