# Testing Deep Links - Device Matching Issue

## The Problem

You're running Expo Go on your **phone**, but clicking the magic link from your **PC email**. This creates a mismatch:

1. **Email link clicked on PC** ‚Üí Opens in PC browser
2. **Deep link `todomorning://`** ‚Üí PC doesn't know what to do with it (no Expo Go on PC)
3. **Result:** White screen or nothing happens

## ‚úÖ Solution: Test on the Same Device

You need to click the magic link **on the same device where Expo Go is running** (your phone).

### Option 1: Open Email on Phone (Easiest)

1. **Open your email on your phone** (the same phone running Expo Go)
2. **Click the "Confirm your mail" link** in the email
3. **Expected:** App should open and handle the deep link

### Option 2: Copy Link from PC to Phone

1. **On PC:** Right-click the magic link ‚Üí "Copy link address"
2. **Send to phone:** 
   - Email it to yourself
   - Or use a messaging app
   - Or copy to clipboard and sync (if you have that)
3. **On phone:** Open the copied link in a browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.)
4. **Click it** ‚Üí Should open Expo Go

### Option 3: Manual Deep Link Test (For Development)

If you want to test the deep link handler directly without the email redirect:

1. **Extract the token from the email link:**
   ```
   From: https://...verify?token=XXXXX&type=magiclink&redirect_to=...
   Token: XXXXX
   ```

2. **On your phone, manually open the deep link:**
   - **Android:** Use a browser and type/paste:
     ```
     todomorning://auth/callback?token=YOUR_TOKEN&type=magiclink
     ```
   - **iOS:** Same as Android

   The browser will prompt to open in Expo Go.

## üîç Why This Happens

- **Deep links (`todomorning://`)** are device-specific
- They need a registered app handler on the same device
- PC browsers don't know about your phone's Expo Go installation
- So the redirect fails silently (white screen)

## ‚úÖ Correct Testing Flow

### The Right Way:

1. **Start app on phone** (Expo Go)
2. **Send magic link** (from app on phone)
3. **Open email on phone** (same device!)
4. **Click magic link** (on phone)
5. **App opens** (on phone) ‚Üí Deep link works! ‚úÖ

### The Wrong Way (What You Did):

1. ‚úÖ Start app on phone
2. ‚úÖ Send magic link (from app on phone)  
3. ‚ùå Open email on PC (different device!)
4. ‚ùå Click link on PC ‚Üí Can't open app on phone
5. ‚ùå Result: White screen

## üéØ Quick Test Steps

1. **Make sure Expo Go is running on your phone**
2. **In the app, send a magic link** (enter email, click "Send Magic Link")
3. **On your PHONE, open your email app** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. **Find the Supabase email** (should arrive within seconds)
5. **Click "Confirm your mail" link** (on your phone)
6. **Expected Result:** 
   - Expo Go app opens (or switches to it if already open)
   - You see "Successfully signed in!" message
   - OR you see an error message (but not white screen)

## üì± Platform-Specific Notes

### Android
- Email apps usually handle deep links automatically
- If it opens in a browser first, the browser should still trigger the deep link
- Chrome on Android handles `todomorning://` links well

### iOS
- iOS Mail app handles deep links
- Safari also handles them
- You might get a prompt: "Open in Expo Go?" ‚Üí Click Yes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I click the link on my phone"

1. **Check Expo Go is running** on your phone
2. **Check the link format** - Should contain `todomorning://auth/callback?token=...`
3. **Try copying the link** and pasting it in your phone's browser address bar
4. **Check console logs** in Expo terminal for debug messages

### "Link opens browser but doesn't open app"

1. **Make sure Expo Go is running** (not just installed)
2. **Try closing and reopening Expo Go**
3. **Check `app.json` has `"scheme": "todomorning"`** (we added this ‚úÖ)
4. **Restart Expo dev server** with `npx expo start -c`

### "I see an error message in the app"

Great! This means the deep link worked, but there's an error in the handler. Check:
- Console logs for details (üîó, üì¶, üîë emojis in logs)
- Error message text in the app
- Share the error and I'll help fix it
